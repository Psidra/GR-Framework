Instructions can be see from in game, by clicking "Overview" while in the main menu.
That being said, here are the instructions.
Maybe this should be changed to "maybereadme.txt"? :thinking:

WASD -> Movement
Left Click -> Shoot
Right Click -> Dodge Roll
Q -> Cycle Weapons
X -> Clear Enemy Projectiles on Screen
R -> Reload
P -> Pause/Unpause game
Tab -> Enlarge Minimap
(Left click on teleporter with enlarged minimap to teleport to it.)
